In the image above. It will show you the main page for yourself, but if you clicked on the word "admin" right next to your name it will show a different screen, which will be shown in the picture below.

So in the image below, we will start creating "Roles". We should already be in the admin panel. If you look at the top right corner and see your name. You should see that the word has changed from "Admin" -> "Agent". Click on the word agent and it will bring you to the image below on the website. Next we can click on the tab named "Roles."

Now we can start adding roles. So we can go ahead and click the button "add new roles" Look at the image below for the next step.

In this part we can put down whatever name we want. In my case I will just put down supreme admin. In the 2nd image below we will click on the permissions tab and give permissions to the newly created role of "supreme admin".
Now in the 2nd image below. We will check everybox in every tab to give permission for our supreme admin role. Once we are done we can hit the add role tab and that completes creating the supreme admin role.

In this next step. We will be creating departments. So in the same tab section where you saw the word "roles" there should be another word called "department". We can click on that and move forward with the next step. In the 2nd image below we will click on the button "add new department." **Just a side note, there will be preloaded departments already, so don't mind that and just create a new department.** In the 3rd picture below, you'll see that there is a lot to do, but the main things we will focus on is naming the department and giving it a manager. **In this case you don't need to give it a new manage, since you're already the manager** So now that we have given the department a new name we can just click the finished button and move onto creating "teams."

Now we are in the same section as before. We just have to click on the "teams" tab and you'll see the same image as shown below. We will also click on the "add team" button to create a new team. Teams can be created for example the first group of teams would be dedicated to important tickets that needs to be done within the day. Another team example would be a team that focused on tickets that has a low importance.

In the image above it already has a team called level 1 support. In this case we will create a level 2 support team in the image below.

This part of the guide. We will pretend to give allowence to anyone to create tickets. So in the image below we will click on the settings tab and once the tab is open. We will click on the "User's box."

As you can see in the image below. To allow everyone to create a ticket, we would have to uncheck the box called "Registration Required". After that is done everyone will be able to create any tickets they want.
